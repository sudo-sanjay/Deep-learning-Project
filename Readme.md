##############Steps To Run the Model############

1) Download the two datasets : 
            
                    1) Ravedess dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio
                    2) Twitter data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text
                    3) Place the data in the same directory as the code.

2) To get only the final prediction:
            
                1) Download any english based audio in .wav format and place it in the same directory as the code.
                        [There is one test.wav for testing which can be used]
                2) Run the final_prediction.ipynb file.
                3) We can see the output.
                4) Ignore any warnings.

3) To make changes changes to any of the models we can navigate to specified file and do respective changes.
